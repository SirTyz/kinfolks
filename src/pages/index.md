      text: Arkansas holds a place of great importance to these families. Many of the
        families have been part of this state for hundreds of years, leaving
        their mark in places from the Ozark mountains to the southern
        Mississippi Delta.

        "Folklore is the study of certain aspects of the culture of a group...
        proverbs, riddles, jokes, folk songs, superstitions, traditional houses,

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
